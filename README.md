## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Responsive Design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) - Quick read on responsive design in Tailwind CSS and their breakpoint system.
- [Tailwind CSS customising colours](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) - Documentation on how to use custom colours for your theme. Note that custom colour names should not have spaces in them or else it won't work. That part tripped me up for a while.
